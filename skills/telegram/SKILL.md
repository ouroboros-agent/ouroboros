model_experience:
  what_model_sees: No new tools; the skill relays owner messages, photos and files (documents, video, audio, voice) from Telegram into the normal chat and mirrors replies back, so conversation turns may originate from Telegram without any visible difference. An owner's answer to a quiz card tapped or replied to in Telegram arrives through the same decision ingress as a web-card answer.

# Telegram

One owner-only Telegram integration provides both the established bot bridge
and the optional Mini App. The first positive private Telegram chat binds as
the sole owner. Text, photos and files (documents, video, audio and voice notes within
this integration's 10 MiB download cap) can be sent to Ouroboros, with or without a
caption; replies, photos, videos, documents, typing state, subagent cards, quiz
cards, and opt-in notifications are mirrored back to that owner. A quiz card is
answered by tapping an option or by replying to the card with a free-form
answer; both reach the same host decision ingress as the web UI. Slash commands
keep their ordinary command-mode rules even in replies; quote a literal command
as code or include it inside an explanation to send it as a quiz answer.

Version 1.1 adds richer Telegram formatting, native MP3/M4A playback, and
inline link keyboards. Version 1.1.1 fixes the task-done push, which read the
lifecycle axis as a whole object and warned on every finished task. Version 1.2
adds inbound files, answerable quiz cards, a truthful `degraded` bridge status
while token validation is deferred by a dead network, and a task-done push whose
word and icon follow the host's task phase (done, done with warnings, failed,
cancelled).

Version 1.2.1 marks questions that wait for an owner answer and clears the
waiting line after an answer submitted through Telegram.
Version 1.2.3 serves the stored settings on GET settings/save so the Settings
form shows saved values before Save, and shortens the four long option labels.
Version 1.2.4 always sends one short line when a task does not finish cleanly, with
the same status word and reason sentence the task card shows; the task-completion
toggle now only adds the clean finishes.
Version 1.2.5 shows the whole quiz card: its project, the host's facts about the
asking task, and every option's detail, with localized field names; a card too
long for one Telegram message arrives as ordered parts followed by the keyboard
message, and nothing authored is cut.
Version 1.2.6 edits a sent question card when the host publishes its lifecycle
(`chat.quiz_state`): an answer given on the web settles it, a closed wait drops the
waiting line while the buttons stay, and a finished task says a late answer still
counts as your message. The card only moves forward — nothing reopens an answer.
An open question (no options) is the same whole card without buttons; it asks for
a reply in your own words.

Version 1.2.9 routes every Telegram API call through the optional skill-local
`TELEGRAM_PROXY` setting, including polling, sends, downloads, notifications,
and the companion's menu button lifecycle. The Settings form masks the proxy
and never reads its stored credentials back into the browser.

The Mini App exposes the unchanged Ouroboros SPA through the established
owner-authenticated sidecar and a pinned Cloudflare Quick Tunnel. It is enabled
by default after owner binding and can be turned off independently without
stopping the text bridge. Disabling the skill destroys process-memory Mini App
sessions, stops public exposure, and best-effort restores the prior Telegram
menu button. Rotate the bot token only while the skill is disabled, then
re-enable it.

Delegated task cards lead with the executor's latest words (marked earlier
when retained), followed by problems and compact activity counts. These are
attributed observations, not the supervising task's narration or a completion
receipt; journal gaps and preview omissions remain visible.

Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in Settings, grant it to this skill, enable the skill,
and send the bot a private message to bind the owner. No legacy Telegram skill
state is copied or changed. Installations that use `telegram-bridge` or
`telegram-miniapp-poc` must disable or remove those skills before enabling this
one.

If Telegram requires a proxy, open this skill's Telegram settings and enter
`TELEGRAM_PROXY` as `scheme://[user:password@]host[:port]` (`socks5`, `socks5h`,
`http` or `https`; SOCKS needs an explicit port). Leave the masked field empty
to keep a saved value, or use **Clear saved Telegram proxy** to remove it.
Disable and re-enable the skill after changing the proxy so its poller and
companion also pick up the change. No additional Secrets grant is needed.

The Bot API stays `https://api.telegram.org` with TLS through the proxy and no
redirects. Proxy credentials follow the selected protocol: HTTP and SOCKS do
not encrypt the connection to the proxy; HTTPS does. Invalid proxy settings
produce an error naming the key without its value. With no skill proxy, the
bridge retains its existing direct/ambient-proxy behavior and the companion's
Telegram calls stay direct. This setting does not change the application proxy,
Cloudflare tunnel, Mini App web traffic, or local host requests.

The Mini App supports macOS arm64/x86_64, Linux arm64/x86_64, and Windows
x86_64. Only the explicit unsupported OS/architecture case degrades
independently: the text bridge remains available while Mini App status reports
that no pinned cloudflared asset exists. Invalid host runtime, unsafe state, or
companion registration errors fail the skill load instead of claiming a partial
healthy installation.

Registration, pinned cloudflared selection, and runtime status share one
architecture helper. Only when `platform.machine()` is empty on Windows does
it fall back to `sysconfig.get_platform()`: `win-amd64` selects the pinned
Windows asset; ARM64, 32-bit, and unknown builds remain unsupported in this
fallback. A nonempty machine value takes precedence over the interpreter build;
macOS and Linux use only the machine value.

The Mini App is Beta. Its best-effort Cloudflare Quick Tunnel has no SLA and
does not support Server-Sent Events (SSE). It targets native Telegram clients;
Telegram WebA/WebK are not supported.
