"""``integrate_subagent_patch``: the parent's manifest-first integration tool.

A mutative (acting) subagent returns its changes as a ``workspace.patch`` artifact
(produced by headless finalization, a git diff against the child's base commit).
The parent decides what to do with it — accept one (best-of-N), synthesize several,
or reject. This tool applies isolated self_worktree patches to the parent's repo,
or verifies native external_workspace changes already present in the shared tree.
The parent stays the sole committer: applying stages changes but never
commits; the parent reviews and runs ``commit_reviewed`` itself.

Only the immediate parent integrates a child. A bound copy returns to its
recorded source under the parent's current write rights; legacy patches target
the active repo. Descendant patches still bubble up one level at a time.
