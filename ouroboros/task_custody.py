"""Custody of a task's own execution drives and unread mail (TZ-1 A, V10).

ONE coordinator decides whether a child execution drive may be deleted:
``settle_child_drive``. The drive prune (off the loop thread) and admission
rollback call it; nothing else removes a task's drive. A drive goes only when,
for EVERY task occupying it (its owner and, say, a timeout retry that kept the
original drive), the caller's supervisor probe proves no live owner (unknown
retains), the DURABLE canonical row is settled with post-work closed, child
copy-back was adopted or is blocked by cancellation, no ref promotion is
pending, and every obligation the drive still holds is in canonical custody:

* every deliverable a canonical row, the child's result or the store's own
  registration records inside the child store (derived FIRST, then checked
  against the store: an absent store or file is a missing source, never
  permission), plus every unrecorded file the store lists;
* the input closure of the mail addressed to the task (attachments and their
  manifest sources) and of its task contract;
* the child's verification receipts, unioned into the canonical stream;
* every exact unread mailbox line (``unread_mailbox``), held by the canonical row.

Missing, unreadable or mismatched material RETAINS the drive; a later pass
converges after a restore. A recorded immutable capture is published only from
bytes that verify against it; a mutable file is compared and published by its
CURRENT bytes (agreeing recorded digests prove nothing about them; with its
source gone it is held only by a canonical row whose digest its canonical copy
verifies against and no child-side claim contradicts); a canonical file is never
replaced (a differing copy publishes beside it under a content-named collision);
unrecorded files are carried without inventing rows. Every placement is a
create-only link: a name that appeared after the identity check retains the pass.

Ownership interlock. Preparation (verification, staging into private unserved
staging) runs without locks and writes nothing served. The probe is re-asked
BEFORE the custody locks (it takes the supervisor's queue lock; a custody holder
never takes that lock). Phase A takes each occupant's custody lock - the lock
every publisher of the canonical store shares (copy-back, ref retry, host
artifact finalization, mailbox cleanup, this settlement) - re-reads the row
against its attempt basis and custody revision, unions receipts, derives the
input closure from the CURRENT mailbox and the durable unread rows (a held
projection is re-verified, an absent one carried), re-checks each destination's
identity, places staged files, and writes ONE same-status row projected from the
row-locked CURRENT, then re-reads it. The maintenance generation is re-asked
after the locks are taken, before receipts, inputs and files move and at the row
commit, and every write owner asks it right before each copy, placement or unlink
(``publication_fence``): a close observed there starts no further effect. Phase B
runs under the caller's ``guard`` - the supervisor's queue lock, which admission and
assignment hold - and, under fresh custody and mail locks, re-takes the occupant
census, re-asks the probe, re-checks every row and mailbox, and only then moves the
drive out of its place. Nothing under the queue lock copies or hashes, so Phase A is
not atomic with queue admission: an owner admitted after its probe can meet the
settled attempt's create-only canonical files, while the attempt basis refuses the
row write and Phase B's probe keeps the drive. Lock order: supervisor queue lock ->
task custody lock -> task mail lock -> task-result row lock -> jsonl append lock.
Row projectors and effective reads never take a lock.

Unread mail (V10): an accepted terminal transition captures the exact mailbox
lines no attempt acknowledged (read before the row lock, unioned under it), and
custody only grows (``merge_unread_mail``): exact bytes are the identity, never a
``msg_id``. Reads here are pure: ``store_artifact_view`` lists the task's own
stores without hashing, copying or registering anything, ranks identity claims
(immutable capture > measured record > registration > listing) apart from the
file's location, and refuses a conflicting identity instead of downgrading it.
