"""One-writer-per-project lease helpers (multi-project, v6.32.0).

Pure functions consumed by ``supervisor/workers.py::assign_tasks`` under the
queue lock: a PENDING task whose ``project_id`` is already RUNNING is skipped
this assignment pass (projects serialize internally; parallelism happens
BETWEEN projects and via subagent swarms WITHIN a task).

``project_id == ""`` means "no lane": ordinary unscoped tasks never serialize
against each other. Subagents carry their parent's stored ``project_id`` but
hold no lease of their own — the parent task IS the project's writer and its
swarm must not deadlock against itself, so only top-level (non-subagent)
tasks count as lane occupants.
