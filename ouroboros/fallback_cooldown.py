"""Process-local 429-aware cooldown for the cross-model fallback chain (F1, v6.39).

A model that just failed transiently (429 / 5xx / overloaded) is parked on a short
cooldown so the fallback chain skips it for a window instead of immediately hammering it
again. Scope is PER-PROCESS: it bounds re-hits WITHIN one worker — a single task's own
fallback walk and its repeated rounds stop re-trying a just-rate-limited model. It does
NOT coordinate across sibling worker processes (each worker has its own map), so it is
not a swarm-WIDE rate-limit governor; durable cross-worker coordination is the project
journal / task-tree blackboard's job (Phase 3), not this advisory in-process guard. The
cooldown is ADVISORY (never a durable "model is bad" verdict that could strand a user
after a transient provider event), and heal-back is PASSIVE: the entry simply expires by
timestamp. Default-on, fail-soft (every helper degrades to "not cooling / no-op" on a
bad config value).
