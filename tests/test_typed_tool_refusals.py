"""A builtin tool's known failure must leave the producer typed (package P4, issue #739).

The registry types a string result by its FIRST LINE: ``⚠️ IDENTIFIER`` maps through
``LegacyTextResultAdapter`` to a status, while identifier-less prose (``⚠️ File not
found: x``) or a bare ``ERROR: ...`` string is recorded as a SUCCESSFUL call — in
``tools.jsonl``, the outcome classifier and the acceptance packet. A producer that
already knows it failed publishes that fact as a typed ``ToolResult``
(``tool_result._publish_tool_result``) or a first-line marker the adapter types.

This is a SOURCE lint over the builtin tool modules, not a runtime gate: it
constrains how new code is written, never how the agent behaves (BIBLE P5). The
flagged shape is narrow: the text opens with ``ERROR:`` or with ``⚠️`` followed by
something that is not an UPPER_SNAKE identifier — prose, a lowercase name, a bare
capital — AND the real adapter records it ``ok``. A typed-looking marker the adapter
buckets as a warning (``⚠️ X_INVALID``) is a vocabulary question for the adapter's
owner, not this lint (a separate, larger residual — dozens of marker-shaped refusals
recorded ``ok`` — that this allowlist does NOT count), and an adapter that starts
typing a text releases it here. Every surviving site carries a written reason here,
so the allowlist IS the disclosure of the identifier-less residual; a site removed from the tree must be removed
here too (shrink-only), and a file whose count grows fails. It is a per-file COUNT
ratchet: swapping one old site for a new one inside the same file is invisible to
it (disclosed), and the producer's own tests pin individual sites.

Scope limit (disclosed): only RETURNED string literals (plain, f-string with a static
head, or a leading-literal concatenation) are scanned. A failure text that reaches the
model through a variable, a tuple or a helper is invisible to this lint; the typed
producer path is the repair for those, pinned by their own tests.
