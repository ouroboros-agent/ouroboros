"""T5: a promote that names an explicit ``workspace_root`` for a project whose
registry ``working_dir`` is EMPTY records that folder — through the existing
``validate_workspace_root`` canonicalization and an atomic empty-field update
under the projects-registry lock — so the project room is not blind forever.
A non-empty ``working_dir`` is never overwritten (the v6.58.0 invariant), an
invalid path is refused as before, and two concurrent promotes elect one winner.
