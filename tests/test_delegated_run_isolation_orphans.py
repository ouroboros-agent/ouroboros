"""Orphan disposition across NESTED host-minted trees (В7-A) and the orphan
capture read.

Both existing target-mismatch tests use DISJOINT roots, so the containment
change would otherwise land with no failing test. The incident: a swarm fanned
into ``<project>/contributions/<track>`` clones, its children died, and the
recovery root -- whose active root was the PARENT project -- got
``INTEGRATE_DELEGATED_TARGET_MISMATCH`` for a target that was a strict
descendant of its own root, while the capture it was authorized to dispose
read back as "outside selected root=artifact_store".
